```search.py``` contains the script that implements Algorithms 1 and 2.
The method ```main()``` executes everything. The method ```search(all_materials_dictionary, g_carbon,...)``` runs the search; the last parameter of this method is ```search_function```. Either ```no_optimized_search_function(combo, combo_nums,..)``` or ```optimized_search_function(combo, combo_nums,..)``` should be passed for this argument.
